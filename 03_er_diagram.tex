We model our ER diagram (\Cref{fig:er-diagram}) after Pomona College's current
room draw system with a few modifications. Students may be members of various
draw groups, each of which must contain at least one student.

Furthermore, each \emph{Draw Group} must have a \emph{Representative} who will
select a \emph{Collection} of one or more \emph{Room}s for the group. The
collection's total capacity must match the size of the draw group.

Similar to the student/draw group coupling, a \emph{Room} is required to be a
part of exactly one collection. These collections represent individual rooms by
themselves and multiple associated rooms like two-room doubles and friendship
suites. A representative may \emph{Request} a collection and rank the request
for automated room draw; this set of requests and rankings makes up the group's
preferences list. The priority of a request is determined by
\emph{rank\_absolute} which is a function of a draw group's \emph{draw\_num} and
the importance of that request for a draw group relative to their other
requests.

The \emph{Occupy} relation will be set by our AutoDraw system, assigning a draw
group to a collection in accordance with the totally ordered set of all
requests. This allows students in a draw group to later assign themselves to
appropriate rooms within an assigned collection in accordance with the joint
decisions of the members of the draw group.
