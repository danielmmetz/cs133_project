We model our ER diagram (\cref{fig:er-diagram}) after Pomona College's current
room draw system with a few modifications. A \emph{Student} is required to be
a part of at least one \emph{Draw Group}, which consists of one or more
students. We decided to give draw groups a draw number attribute to distinguish
between normal draw and suite draw, the latter averaging individual student draw
numbers. Furthermore, each draw group must have a \emph{Representative} who
will select a \emph{Collection} of one or more rooms for the group, depending
on the size of the group. All students are representatives of themselves in a
group containing only themselves. Similar to the student/draw group coupling, a
\emph{Room} is required to be a part of exactly one collection. These
collections represent individual rooms and multiple associated rooms such as
two-room doubles and friendship suites. A representative may \emph{Request} a
collection and rank the request for automated room draw. That is, if any
requested collections are available at the representative's draw time, the
highest ranked collection will be drawn for the group. These draw times
correspond to a group's absolute rank attribute which is determined by whether
or not the group is a friendship suite and by the group's draw number. Just as a
note, not every draw group will make a request as groups containing students who
are studying abroad will not participate in the request relationship. Along the
same vein, not all rooms on Pomona's campus are occupied at any given time so
not all collections will participate in the request relationship. For the same
reasons, the \emph{Occupy} relationship does not require total participation
by either students or rooms.
