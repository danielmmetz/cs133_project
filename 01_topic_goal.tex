The existing Room Draw process is profoundly inefficient, requiring students to
spend stressful hours watching their desired rooms slowly disappear, and
requiring administrators and RAs to waste time overseeing every step of the
process. If a student is abroad or for any reason not present at the time of
Room Draw, they must specify another student to be their proxy, and draw for
them. The current system requires two days to run to completion: the first is to
draw Friendship Suites (groups of three or more students who wish to live
together), the second is for general draw in which singles and doubles are
allocated. The allocation scheme is different for these two schedules.
Friendship groups are given a draw number equal to the average draw numbers of
the primary four members, where singles and doubles take the lowest draw number
of their members. Rooms are then allocated from lowest to highest draw number.

This project solves much of this issue by not requiring students to be
physically present to draw into a room, and removes much of the administrative
overhead. Students give a list of their room preferences before some deadline,
and then the administrator runs an automatic room draw task that assigns
students to their rooms based on these preferences.
