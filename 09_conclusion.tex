The RoomDraw application as it exists is a well-formed prototype of what we
envision a full-fledged system to be.  It is not a perfect replica of the
existing room draw process---containing some improvements and some minor
inconsistencies. It also lacks certain administrative and UI features.
Nonetheless, it proves that the room draw process can be implemented in a more
efficient and effective manner.

We hope that the Pomona College administration will consider a fully-fledgd
version of our proof of concept; we believe its offerings would improve the
experience for both students and administrators.
