\noindent Below are the key aspects of the business logic that are integral to the functionality of
the RoomDraw application.  

\begin{itemize}
\item A Friendship must have more than three members.
\item A student reference by the leaderID field in a Friendship is a proxy for the
  six students referenced by $sid2 \cdots sid6$
\item In the Occupy table at least on of inFall and inSpring must be true.
\item If a student has requested a room in a collection, that student must request every
  room in that collection.
\item Queries for Suites are a search for Collections with non-NULL suiteNum attributes. The other
  collections have $k$ rooms and $k$ students, where the student with the highest room draw number
  ``pulls up'' the remaining $k-1$ students.
\item For Frienships, the roomDrawNumber is calculated on the creation of the friendship.  It is
  the average of the numbers of all of the students.  The student designated by leaderID is a proxy
  for the remaining students represented by $sid2 \cdots sid6$
\item In a Student's preferences list, the rooms selected by the friendship automatically have higher
  rank than the rest.
\end{itemize}
