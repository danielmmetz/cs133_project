\subsection{Ambitions}

We wish to implement an online transaction processing system for Pomona College
room draw. We roughly model our implementation ideas after the current course
registration system.

\subsection{Functionalities}

Our ideal is a proof of concept of a working Room Draw replacement system. Our
core functionality includes:

\begin{outline}
\1 students signing up for singles, doubles, or friendship suites
\1 students to create friendship suite groups
\1 students authorizing other students as proxies
\1 students to search for rooms
    \2 offer filtering by property (e.g. taken, vacant, location, dorm, sq-ft,
    etc.)
\1 an ``auto draw'' system
    \2 We define an ``auto draw'' system as one in which students may provide an
    ordered list of room preferences, to allow for automated room selection at
    draw time given room availabilities.
\end{outline}

Possible extensions include:

\begin{outline}
\1 include access to room reviews in system
\1 include a notification system
\1 including all the actual rooms around campus
\1 include historical data as context for each room (another property of the
    room)
\1 permit 5C campus exchanges (e.g. CMC student living at Pomona)
\1 generation of room draw numbers/times
\1 administrator override (e.g. allow Bedoya to move students around or modify
    draw numbers/times).
\end{outline}
