\subsection{Ambitions}

We wish to implement an online transaction processing system for Pomona College
room draw. We roughly model our implementation ideas after the current course
registration system.

\subsection{Functionalities}

Our system should handle:

\begin{outline}
\1 students signing up for singles, doubles, or friendship suites
\1 students to create friendship suite groups
\1 students authorizing other students as proxies
\1 students to search for rooms
    \2 offer filtering by property (e.g. taken, vacant, location, dorm, sq-ft,
    etc.)
\1 an ``auto draw'' system
    \2 We define an ``auto draw'' system as one in which students may provide an
    ordered list of room preferences, to allow for automated room selection at
    draw time given room availabilities.
\end{outline}
